    "The purpose of any heat engine is to generate a useable form of energy (such as electricity) from the heat extracted from a hot reservoir (such as a furnace). A _Carnot heat engine_ is a theoretical heat engine in which one imagines taking an ideal gas through a sequence of reversible expansions and contractions of an ideal gas that ends up with the gas in the exact same state it started in. This sequence is called a _Carnot cycle_, and is often depicted in an _indicator diagram_ such as Fig. 1. The upper curve of this cycle (from point A to B) is the isothermal heat extraction leg that gets the engine started: during this leg, the gas is in thermal contact with the hot reservoir and extracts heat from it. Subsequent legs of the cycle trace out a clockwise closed loop in this diagram, as indicated by the arrows in the figure. The cycle is called a _closed thermodynamic cycle_ because the gas returns to its initial state at the end. \n",

    "The idea of this exercise is that you'll gain insight into the formulas for isothermal and adiabatic reversible changes in an ideal gas, by generating a numerical representation of the Carnot cycle. You will also gain some practice at numerical integrate, by numerically finding the work generated or consumed at each leg. That, in turn, will allow you to test the fundamental theoretical results mentioned above."
