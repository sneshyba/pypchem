    "### Computational Guided Inquiry for PChem (Neshyba, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to atomic units\n",
    "In this module, you'll get an introduction to Python coding in Jupyterhub Notebook. It'll be mostly about navigating your way around this \"ecosystem.\" The context will be what's called the blackbody radiance or Planck formula, which provides the intensity of light energy coming off a solid object,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B_\\nu = {2 h \\nu^3 \\over c^2}{ 1 \\over exp({h\\nu \\over k_B T})-1} \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu$ is the frequency of light, $c$ is the speed of light, $h$ is Planck's constant, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the solid (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law; this is analogous to Eq. $I2.3$ in Shepherd & Grushow.). Its derivation by Max Planck -- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck -- was a fundamental step in the path to the development (or should we say \"discovery\"?) of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown cells and code cells\n",
    "The text you're reading is enclosed in a box called a \"markdown cell.\" Markdown cells have text, equations, etc. A second type of cell is called a \"code cell.\" Code cells do all the computing work in a Python Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E-format convention for scientific notation\n",
    "When working in a computational environment like Python, it's important to get used to entering numbers in scientific notation using the *e-format convention*. For example, Boltzmann's constant, $k_B$, might be written $1.3806Ã—10^{-23}$ (in units $m^2 \\ kg \\ s^{-2} \\ K^{-1}$), but in Python you would enter it as \"1.3806e-23\". The \"e\" can be \"E\", by the way; the e-format convention is not case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named variables\n",
    "Trying to not overload you too much in this introduction, but one more idea that will help as you go through this module is that Python has a built-in way of storing quantities, called *named variables*. What we mean by this is, when you calculate a quantity (say, the intensity of light energy emitted by a solid object), you have the option of giving that intensity a unique  name -- it can be as simple as \"R\" -- then Python will keep that value for you to use later. This might not sound like much, but when you're faced with the complex, multi-step calculations typical of quantum mechanics, it's very handy -- essential, really. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherent unit systems\n",
    "The foregoing example brings up a key point: unless a number is dimensionless (like $\\pi$), we need to pay attention to its *units*. Units are always a bit of a bother in ... all of pchem. There are two aspects of this that you need to be aware of, that will make dealing with units a lot easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Coherence*. Designed properly, units come in collections called *coherent unit systems*. For example, in the SI unit system (a favorite among thermodynamicists), the unit for time is seconds, for distance it's meters, etc. Turns out, SI is a bit awkward for atomic-scale manipulation, however. For example, Planck's constant $\\hbar=1.055 \\times 10^{-34}$ Joule-seconds (it's just so *small*). A coherent unit system more useful for quantum-mechanical calculations is the Hartree atomic unit system, in which $\\hbar=1$!\n",
    "\n",
    "*The SI guarantee (or Atomic Unit Guarantee)*. A recurring question in any quantitative science is, what are the units of formulas like $B_\\nu$ above? You *could* go through the bother of unit analysis of all the variables that go *into* the calculation ($\\nu$, $c$, etc.), to figure that out. OR you could recognize that in a coherent unit system, you are *guaranteed* that if the inputs belong to a given coherent unit system, then the output (in this case, $B_\\nu$) belongs to the same unit system! That means, if $\\nu$, $c$, etc. are in SI, then $B_\\nu$ is SI, and if $\\nu$, $c$, etc. are in atomic units, then $B_\\nu$ is in atomic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement) for a complete definition of coherence, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units for details about the SI system, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units for a description of the Hartree atomic unit system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit managers\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the managing of units is all made much simpler thanks to a unit system handler called *pint* (see http://pint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/nonmult.html). This CGI module will get you grounded in the basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (and most hand-held calculators) have built-in functions, like $e^x$ or $sin(x)$. But we'll have need to create our own functions too. One example: the Planck blackbody radiance function defined in Eq. (1). You'll get some practice at that in this CGI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise can be phrased follows. \n",
    "1. I can create named variables in Python.\n",
    "1. I can enter numbers in scientific notation using the E-format convention.\n",
    "1. I'm familiar with key aspects of *pint*, e.g., specifying quantities with units, and making conversions.\n",
    "1. I'm familiar with constants often used in a quantum-mechanical context: $c$ is speed of light, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.\n",
    "1. I'm familiar with the syntax of Python functions, and can use them."
