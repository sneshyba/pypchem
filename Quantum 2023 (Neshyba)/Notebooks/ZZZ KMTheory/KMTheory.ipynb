    "# A kinetic-molecular approach to reversible expansion of an ideal gas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This CGI is all about exploring the question, what's going on at the molecular level when we carry out an isothermal reversible expansion of a gas? Why, for example, does heat go in at all, and why does is that amount of heat equal to $nRT \\ ln \\bigl ({V_{final} \\over V_{initial}} \\bigr )$? Our basic premise here is that if we think about this heat as compensatation for the loss of speed that molecules undergo when they hit a slowly receding wall, then we have achieved a degree of molecular-level insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A hybrid (numerical+theoretical) kinetic-molecular approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the result of an analysis of the physics of objects slamming against a receding wall. If that process is elastic (as Physicists are wont to insist on), one can show that those objects will bounce back with their speed reduced by $2v_{wall}$. That reduction in speed, in turn, implies the kinetic energy of those objects (OK, molecules) will also be reduced. If we want our process to be isothermal, then we can say that this reduction in kinetic energy would have to be compensated by an equal inflow of heat from the surroundings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic-molecular theory says that this inflow of heat is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dq_{kinetic} = -Z \\times \\delta KE \\times A \\times dt \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complex expression, but we hope you can see why it has to work, based on the factors that go into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Z$ is the frequency with which molecules hit our wall (typical units: mole / meter$^2$ / second). Kinetic theory says $Z = {1 \\over 2} \\rho \\times v$, where $\\rho$ is the number density of the gas (mol / m$^2$), the factor ${1 \\over 2}$ is there because only half the molecules at any given moment are heading toward the wall in question, and $v$ is the speed of the molecules in the gas. That speed, in turn, can be inferred from the equipartition theorem, which says that each degree of freedom (in this case, motion in the x-direction) has an average energy of ${1 \\over 2}RT$, and we know that kinetic energy is related to speed by $KE = {1 \\over 2}Mv^2$ (where $M$ is the mass of a mole of molecules).\n",
    "- $\\delta KE$ is the change in kinetic energy of a mole of molecules hitting the receding wall (typical units: J/mol). As mentioned previously, for elastic collisions, each molecule's speed will be reduced by $2v_{wall}$ after it hits the wall.\n",
    "- $A$ is the area of the wall getting hit (meter$^2$)\n",
    "- $dt$ is the time interval (seconds) needed to for the wall to move out some small distance $dx$, i.e, $dt={dx \\over v_{wall}}$. This is also related directly to the final volume, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these considerations don't convince you, you can try one more thing: do a unit analysis on the right hand side of Eq. 1. If the result has dimensions energy, we're on the right track!\n",
    "\n",
    "For an expansion that's too big to be considered \"infinitessimally small\", we'll need to add up a series of tiny $dq_{kinetic}$ values appearing in Eq. 1, until the gas has expanded to our final, desired volume. Written in calculus-y terms, This accumulated heat is \n",

    "which is what Numpy's np.sum function does. \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of notes about implementing Eq. (3). First, we'd need to make sure that each $dq_{kinetic}$ in the sum is small enough that it's a good approximation to a bona fide (calculus-y) infinitessimal quantity. Second, we'd need to make sure that the starting volume for each tiny step is the ending volume of the previous step. (Were just mentioning this because we forgot to do that the first time through this.)\n",

    "And what does Thermodynamics have to say about this? Going back to a very small expansion, we can say that the infinessimal work done by an expanding gas is $dw = -P_{ex}dV$. Under isothermal and reversible conditions, for an ideal gas, and invoking the 1st Law, this translates to \n",

    "## Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise are \n",
    "1. I can provide a qualitative, molecular-level explanation for why heat must flow into a gas as it expands isothermally and reversibly.\n",
    "1. I can use kinetic-molecular theory to predict the heat that flows into an ideal gas as it expands reversibly and isothermally.\n",
    "1. I can explain the basis for that calculation, including the equipartition theory, elastic collision theory, and the frequency-of-collision theory. \n",
    "1. I can show that this formulation matches predictions using the the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, both for expansions that are tiny, and large (via integration)."
