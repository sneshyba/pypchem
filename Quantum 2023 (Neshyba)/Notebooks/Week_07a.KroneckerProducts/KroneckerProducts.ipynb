    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, one of our goals is to show how to construct matrices representing kinetic energy in three dimensions, extending the pattern we followed in two dimensions, using the Kronecker product. We'll also be taking a look at some of the analytical properties of those matrices, so that you'll become a little more comfortable about using these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix representation of $\\nabla^2$ in 2d\n",
    "Previously, we considered the kinetic energy operators of a particle moving in each of two Cartesian dimensions, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "KE = {-\\hbar^2 \\over 2 m} \\nabla^2  \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla^2$ is the sum of second derivatives, ${\\partial^2 \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\over \\partial y^2}$. We can think about matrices corresponding to $\\nabla^2$ using formulas like\n",
    "\n",
    "    del2x = (-2.0*np.diag(np.ones(nx))+np.diag(np.ones(nx-1),1)+np.diag(np.ones(nx-1),-1)) /dx**2\n",
    "\n",
    "and similarly for the y-direction. Then, with the help of identity matrices like \n",
    "\n",
    "    Ix = np.diag(np.ones(nx))\n",
    "\n",
    "we can construct the matrix representation of $\\nabla^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "    del2_2d = np.kron(del2x,Iy) + np.kron(Ix,del2y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "where np.kron is numpy's Kronecker delta function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix representation of $\\nabla^2$ in 3d\n",
    "Formally, this is is constructed in an analogous way, e.g.,  \n",
    "\n",
    "    del2_3d = PL.kron3(del2x,Iy,Iz) + PL.kron3(Ix,del2y,Iz) + PL.kron3(Ix,Iy,del2z)\n",
    "    \n",
    "where PL.kron3 is a three-dimensional generalization of Numpy's kron2 function, supplied in our PchemLibrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops\n",
    "In order to compare the eigenvalues of a Kronecker product matrix to the eigenvalues of the lower-dimensional matrices that went into making it, it will be useful to set up some loops. You'll see how those work in the 2d example below; the 3d case is a straightforward extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise are:\n",
    "1. I can predict the size of Kronecker product matrices that will arise from matrices of lower dimension.\n",
    "1. I can construct those Kronecker product matrices, and can identify whether it is diagonal, tridiagonal, etc.\n",
    "1. I can predict the eigenvalues of Kronecker product matrix based on the eigenvalues of the lower-dimensional matrices that went into making it.\n",
    "1. I can set up Python loops."
