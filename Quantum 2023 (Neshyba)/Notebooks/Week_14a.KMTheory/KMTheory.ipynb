    "# A kinetic-molecular approach to reversible expansion of an ideal gas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This CGI is all about exploring the question, what's going on at the molecular level when we carry out an isothermal reversible expansion of a gas? Why, for example, is it necessary for heat to go in, to maintain a constant temperature? Our basic premise here is that if we think about this heat as compensatation for the loss of speed that molecules experience when they bounce back from a slowly receding wall, then we have achieved a degree of molecular-level insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A hybrid (numerical+theoretical) kinetic-molecular approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the result of an analysis of the physics of objects slamming against a receding wall. If we can assume that that process is elastic (as physicists like to do), one can show when those objects will bounce back,  their will be speed reduced by $2v_{wall}$. That reduction in speed, in turn, implies the kinetic energy of those objects (OK, molecules) will also be reduced. If we want our process to be isothermal, then we can say that this reduction in kinetic energy would have to be compensated by an equal inflow of heat from the surroundings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic-molecular theory says that this inflow of heat is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dq_{kinetic} = -Z \\times \\delta KE \\times A \\times dt \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a longish expression, but we hope you can see why it works, based on the factors that go into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Z$ is the frequency with which molecules hit our wall (typical units: mole / meter$^2$ / second). Kinetic theory says $Z = {1 \\over 2} \\rho \\times v$, where $\\rho$ is the number density of the gas (the factor ${1 \\over 2}$ is there because only half the molecules at any given moment are heading toward the wall in question), and $v$ is the speed of the molecules in the gas. That speed, in turn, can be inferred from the equipartition theorem, which says that each degree of freedom (in this case, motion in the x-direction) has an average energy of ${1 \\over 2}RT$. We can get from kinetic energy to speed using $KE = {1 \\over 2}Mv^2$, where $M$ is the mass of a mole of molecules.\n",
    "- $\\delta KE$ is the change in kinetic energy of a mole of molecules hitting the receding wall (typical units: J/mol). As mentioned previously, for elastic collisions, each molecule's speed will be reduced by $2v_{wall}$ after it hits the wall.\n",
    "- $A$ is the area of the wall getting hit (meter$^2$)\n",
    "- $dt$ is the time (seconds) needed to for the wall to move out some distance $dx$, i.e, $dx=v_{wall}dt$. This is also related to the final volume, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these considerations don't convince you that Eq. 1 makes sense, you can try one more thing: do a unit analysis. If the right hand side has dimensions energy, we're on the right track!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simplified kinetic-molecular approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The foregoing has a distinct numerical/algorithmic air to it. It will give results that are as accurate as you please, as long as you make $dt$ (and therefore $dx$) small enough. But the development also shows us how to use kinetic-molecular theory to get an analytical result. One key relationship is that $\\delta KE = {\\partial KE \\over \\partial v} \\delta v$, where ${\\partial KE \\over \\partial v}$ can be got from taking the derivative of $KE = {1 \\over 2}Mv^2$, and $\\delta v=2v_{wall}$. If you put all this together, and notice that $Adx=dV$, you can come up with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dq_{kinetic,simplified} =  n M v^2 {dV \\over V} \\ \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular old thermodynamic theory\n",
    "\n",
    "And what does Thermodynamics have to say about this? Going back to a very small expansion, we can say that the infinessimal work done by an expanding gas is $dw = -P_{ex}dV$. Under isothermal and reversible conditions, for an ideal gas, and invoking the 1st Law, this translates to \n",
    " \n",
    "$$\n",
    "dq_{thermo} = nRT {dV \\over V} \\ \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea of this exericse\n",
    "A test of the kinetic-molecular theory laid out above would, naturally, be to evaluate whether Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 give (close to) the same answers. If so, we can conclude that there's some validity to the notion that the heat that flows into an expanding gas is compensating for the reduction in the kinetic energy of molecules hitting the receding wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise are \n",
    "1. I can provide a qualitative, molecular-level explanation for why heat must flow into a gas as it expands isothermally and reversibly.\n",
    "1. I can use kinetic-molecular theory to predict the heat that flows into an ideal gas as it expands reversibly and isothermally.\n",
    "1. I can explain the basis for that calculation, including the equipartition theory, elastic collision theory, and the frequency-of-collision theory. \n",
    "1. I can show that this formulation matches predictions using the the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, both for expansions that are tiny, and large (via integration)."
