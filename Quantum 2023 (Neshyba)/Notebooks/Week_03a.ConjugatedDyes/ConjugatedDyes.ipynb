    "These MOs were computed using Spartan$^{TM}$ at the PM3 level. Spartan/PM3 is thought to provide a reasonable representation of the shapes of the orbitals, but it's *terrible* in a quantitative sense. How do we know that? The real dyes we are considering here have HOMO->LUMO gaps that definitely lie in the visible range. As an  example, Fig. 5 shows a spectrum of an extended version of one of these dyes. The value of $\\lambda_{max} \\approx 700 \\ nm$ you can see in this figure corresponds to red light. If you do the conversion, you'll see that this $\\lambda_{max}$ implies a HOMO->LUMO gap on the order of $1.8 \\ eV$. But Spartan/PM3 predicts HOMO->LUMO gaps for this (and similar) dyes in excess of $5 \\ eV$. If that were really the case, these dyes would be colorless (which is to say, not dyes at all ... at least for humans).\n",
    "\n",
    "This poor quantitative accuracy of Spartan$^{TM}$ at the PM3 level is a pity, but not to be dismayed: we can use other theory for that purpose. What theory? Well, Particle-on-a-Line theory! \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Your group will be assigned a family. Then, you'll use a spectrometer to measure $\\lambda_{max}$ for each dye in that family. But here's the deal: you don't know which family member is which. You'll need to use your spectrometric results in combination with Spartan and Particle-on-a-Line theory to identify them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what we just said will involve inferring values of $\\lambda_{max}$ from your Particle-on-a-Line results. This is provided by the *Planck relation*, which can take various forms (see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_relation). One is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{gap} = h \\nu \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is handy if you have a spectrum in which the x-axis is $\\nu$. In its wavelength form, this translates to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{gap} = h c / \\lambda_{max} \\ \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is handy when we want to compare a calculated quantity, e.g., $E_{gap}$ from Particle-on-a-Line theory, to an experimentally obtained $\\lambda_{max}$. That's what we'll be doing in this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "To make the corresponding prediction using Particle-on-a-Line theory, you'll need some geometric information from Spartan: the length of the \"line\" over which $\\pi$-type orbitals extend (a quantity we've called $a$). We've begun this process by identifying the relevant paths in Figs. 1-4. More particularly, if you follow the arc of high electron density from left to right, and count the bonds along the way -- and apply the short-cut correction we worked out previously -- you'll be able to get $a$. A note about what we just said, however: in the \"2,2'\" family, it's arguable that there are *two* paths in the arc. You might want to average them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need Particle-on-a-line quantum number assignments, but you can do that in the same way you've done before for other $\\pi$-conjugated systems: along the arc just mentioned, count the number of blotches along the way, and you'll have $n$. These are more obvious in the $n=6$ cases (Figs. 2 and 4) but still discernable for the $n=7$ cases (Figs. 1 and 3), which are the HOMOs for those molecules. You'll have to convince yourself, in Spartan, that the LUMO in each case is $n=8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling up to the next member of each family entails adding two C-C bond lengths, and bumping up the HOMO and LUMO quantum numbers too. Ditto when you go to the third member of each family.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise are: \n",
    "1. I can quote off the top of my head the range of visible light, in nm, eV, and hartree.\n",
    "1. I know how to use Planck's relation in various ways, e.g., to relate measured $\\lambda_{max}$ values to $E_{gap}$.\n",
    "1. I know how to use theory of delocalized electrons (the \"Particle-on-a-Line\" in combination with electronic structure software, like Spartan) to predict HOMO->LUMO energy gaps of dyes."
