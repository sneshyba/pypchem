    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "In this module, you'll get an introduction to Python coding in Jupyterhub Notebook. It'll be mostly about navigating your way around this \"ecosystem.\" The context will be something you're hopefully a little familiar with -- the ideal gas law.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown cells and code cells\n",
    "The text you're reading is enclosed in a box called a \"markdown cell.\" Markdown cells have text, equations, etc. Most markdown cells you'll be working with will be read-only, meaning you're not supposed to change them. You can execute a markdown cell by pressing the return key while holding down shift. Try it now! You'll see that not much seems to have happened (because this is a read-only cell). As we go along, however, you'll see that some markdown cells are set aside for you to respond to a prompt of some kind -- usually to reflect or analyze something you've just done or seen. You execute those in the same way: after editing, you'll press return while holding down shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second type of cell is called a \"code cell.\" Code cells do all the computing work in a Python Notebook. You'll also be executing code cells, in the same way (shift-return). But more on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E-format convention for scientific notation\n",
    "When working in a computational environment like Python, it's important to get used to entering numbers in scientific notation using the *e-format convention*. For example, Boltzmann's constant, $k_B$, might be written $1.3806Ã—10^{-23}$ (in units $m^2 \\ kg \\ s^{-2} \\ K^{-1}$), but in Python you would enter it as \"1.3806e-23\". The \"e\" can be \"E\", by the way; the e-format convention is not case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit conversions and coherent unit systems\n",
    "The foregoing example brings up a key point: unless a number is dimensionless (like $\\pi$), we need to pay attention to its *units*. Units are always a bit of a bother in ... all of pchem ... because one is frequently faced with having to do unit conversions. Fortunately, Python has a nice package, call *pint*. *pint*  has a ton of built-in conversions, it knows how to convert from one to another, and it's pretty intuitive (more on this below). If you've wrestled in the past with unit conversions, this might seem just a bit too easy. But mainly it removes the drudgery of unit conversions; you still have to know what you're doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing about units, is that they're not as arbitrary as you might think. Units come in collections, called *unit systems*. For example, in the SI unit system (a favorite among thermodynamicists), the unit for time is seconds, for distance it's meters, etc. Moreover, if a unit system been designed properly, it has a property called *coherence*. Lots of calculations become simplified when a unit system has coherence. For example, say you are working in the SI unit system, and you have calculated an acceleration using $a=F/m$. You *could* go through the bother of unit analysis of $F$ and $a$ to figure out the units of $a$. OR you could recognize that SI is a coherent unit system, so you are *guaranteed* that if $F$ and $a$ are SI, then $a$ is *guaranteed* to be $m/s^2$ (and not $miles/hour^2$ or something else). Yes, guaranteed! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement) for a complete definition of coherence, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units for details about the SI system, and http://pint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/nonmult.html for a description of *pint*. The point for now is, the combination of unit coherenence and *pint* is pretty powerful, and this module will get you grounded in the basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Named variables\n",
    "Trying to not overload you too much in this introduction, but one more idea that will help as you go through this module is that Python has a built-in way of storing quantities, called *named variables*. That means if you use Eqs. (1) and (2) to calculate two pressures, and you give these pressures different names (like \"P\" and \"Pvdw\"), then Python will keep those values for you to use later. This might not sound like much, but when you're faced with the complex, multi-step calculations typical of thermodynamcis, it's very handy -- essential, really. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Chemical context - ideal gases and van der Waals gases\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of predicting the pressure of a gas is to use what's called the *Ideal Gas Law*,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = {{n R T} \\over V} \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the pressure of a gas, $V$ is the volume of the container it's in, $n$ is the amount of gas in that container, and $R$ is called the *Universal Gas Constant*, $8.314 {{J \\over {mol \\ K}}}$. You might be familiar with Eq. (1) in different forms, like $PV = n R T$, $n = {{PV} \\over {RT}}$, etc., but of course those are just different algebraic expressions of the same relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another prediction is given by the *van der Waals* (vdw) equation, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = {{n R T} \\over {V - nb}} - {{n^2 a} \\over V^2}  \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are called van der Waals constants. These constants -- they are specific to each gas -- are tabulated in various places, inluding your text, and at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_constants_(data_page). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison metrics\n",
    "So, how good are these formulas? (Chemists tend to ask this about *any* \"law\", for that matter; we're a suspicious lot.) The best comparison, of course, would be to compare the pressure predicted by Eq. (1) to an experimental value, but that's not always very convenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding that question about the accuracy of the ideal gas law, there are several options we can imagine. \n",
    "- We could just inspect the difference, $P_{vdw} - P_{ideal}$ (or $P_{ideal} - P_{vdw}$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The percent difference, $({P_{vdw}}/{P_{ideal}}-1)\\times 100$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ratio, $P_{vdw}/P_{ideal}$, etc. In that case, of course, you'd be interested in deviations from one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, we'll be evaluating these differences at more or less room conditions, and for a particular gas (Argon), but later we'll be exploring how that varies from gas to gas, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "The main learning goals of this exercise can be phrased follows. \n",
    "1. I can create named variables in Python.\n",
    "1. I can enter numbers in scientific notation using the E-format convention.\n",
    "1. I'm familiar with key aspects of *pint*, e.g., specifying quantities with units, and making persistent or on-the-fly conversions.\n",
    "1. I'm familiar with common pressure units (atm, bar, pascal, and torr), and can sort them in order of how big they are.\n",
    "1. I can carry out algebraic and numerical calculations involving the ideal gas law, and evaluate the error in it relative to more accurate formulations, such as vdw's equation."
