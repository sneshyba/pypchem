    "# Warming of an ice-free Arctic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the last few decades, the temperature of the Arctic region has been rising fast -- at a rate of about 1 degree per decade (see https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2020/arctic-temperatures). That's as much as *four times* faster than the rest of the Earth has been warming (see https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3). This extra warming, called *Arctic amplification*, is thought to be due primarily to the reduction in the coverage of ice and snow in the Arctic region, mostly land ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature difference you'll calculate here is all about an *additional* kind of Arctic amplification, on top of what the Arctic has already experienced, due to the complete disappearence of ice and snow over the Arctic *ocean*. Arctic amplification due to this mechanism hasn't fully kicked in yet because Arctic sea ice is still present in the summer, but we know it is happening -- you can see the trend in Fig. 1 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: center;'>\n",
    "<img src=https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-ux-2880-1000,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2015_38/1223536/150915-science-arctic_ice.jpg height=\"500\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica, is also losing ice, by the way -- see Fig. 2.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positive feedbacks and tipping points\n",
    "Now, you might make the following objection at this point: isn't the disappearance of sea ice itself the result of an increase in temperature due to human emissions of $CO_2$ in the first place? Yes it is! So what we're really saying here is that $CO_2$-induced warming and sea ice loss feed off one another. The net result is more warming because of this *positive feedback* between the two processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive feedbacks are especially worrisome because embedded in them is the idea that at a certain point, these feedback mechanisms might lead to what is called a *tipping point*. That's when a new process is activated that brings on even more warming, regardless of what humans do. Avoiding tipping points in climate is a big reason the signers of the Paris Climate Agreement (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) stipulated that we should really, really keep warming under $1.5-2$ degrees Celsius. One big worry is that the Arctic has already passed, or is at least very close to, a tipping point in which summertime Arctic sea ice will go away permanently, and therefore the warming it will cause will be with us even if humans back off on the $CO_2$ they emit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea of this CGI\n",
    "This CGI is an exploration of how much the Arctic's temperature would go up as a result of the the additional mechanism just mentioned, the loss of ice and snow in the Arctic Ocean. Figure 3 shows the factors we'll be considering here. The questions we'll be focusing on are: How much additional warming might there be? and How does that compare with the Arctic amplification we've seen so far? \n",

    "## Part 1. Heat capacity of the photic layer of the Arctic Ocean\n",
    "Where to start? You probably have an intuition about this: when you try to heat something up, the more massive it is, the harder it is to heat it up. In our case, we'll need the total mass of the *photic layer* of the ocean (top 200 meters) of the Arctic Ocean, since that's the layer that will be absorbing most of that additional sunlight once the cover of sea ice is gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "mass = Area \\times Depth \\times Density \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Those quantities have been measured -- some by satellite, others in laboratories. Check out these sources for values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean\n",
    "- https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/ocean/layers-of-ocean\n",
    "- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone\n",
    "- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the heat capacity, $C$, of the photic layer, we can use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C = C_s \\times mass \\ \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_s$ is called the *specific heat capacity* of water. That's also a known quantity (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_specific_heat_capacities).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2. The insolation impact\n",
    "We'll also need to know the difference in solar energy getting into the Arctic Ocean when the ice is gone. We can start with how much light is hitting the surface in the first place. That's called the *insolation*, and symbolized as $I$. Insolation varies with the time of year, and with the latitude, but that's all been worked out -- check out the 8th figure down at http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2013/06/open-water-in-areas-around-north-pole.html, as an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, melting ice doesn't change $I$ -- that's controlled by the sun. But melting does change the fraction of $I$ that actually warms the surface. That's because sea ice reflects away a lot more sunlight than the open ocean does. This reflectivity has a special name in climate science: it's called the *albedo*. Albedos of all kinds of surface types have been measured -- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more note about this -- there are clouds above the ocean in the Arctic that also reflect sunlight. What that means is, the sensitivity, $s_{sur}$, of the overall albedo of the Arctic to changes in the surface albedo, is small -- only about 11% (see https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/1/12). \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the end, we have a solar insolation difference given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta I = (\\alpha_{ice} - \\alpha_{ocean}) \\times Area \\times s_{sur} \\times I \\ \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Area$ is the same as what we've already considered, namely, the areal extent of the Arctic Ocean. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3. The energy impact\n",
    "Now we're ready to find the energy difference resulting from the extra sunlight being absorbed after the cover of snow and ice is gone. It's given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E = \\Delta I \\times \\Delta t \\ \\ \\ \\ (4)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ is the length of time the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free. If we say the entire summer is ice-free, we'd specify $\\Delta t \\approx 3 $ months.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4. The temperature impact\n",
    "\n",
    "A pretty straightforward thermodynamic analysis says that the temperature change we can expect when that additional energy is absorbed by the photic layer of the Arctic Ocean will be given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta T = {\\Delta E  \\over C}  \\ \\ \\ \\ (5)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "## Background reading\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I know the months of the year when Arctic sea ice extent is a maximum and a minimum;\n",
    "1. I can explain why sea ice around Antarctica shows the opposite pattern;\n",
    "1. I can explain how the following terms relate to climate: *positive feedback*, *albedo*, *specific heat capacity*, *insolation*, *photic layer*, *Arctic Amplification*, and *tipping point*;\n",
    "1. Given the mass of a substance, I can find its *total heat capacity* from its *specific heat capacity*;\n",
    "1. Given an area of interest, I can find the *total insolation* of a region from the *insolation* of a representative part of the region; and\n",
    "1. I can predict how much the Arctic is likely to warm when summertime ice disappears."
