    "Everybody knows that gases are compressible - they become denser when the pressure goes up. But not all gases do this in exactly the same way.  That's because a gas's compressibility is influenced by intermolecular forces, which we know vary from gas to gas.  That, in turn, implies something rather intriguing to a physical chemist: it means that by studying gas density, we can gain insight into how gas molecules interact!  That is one reason why physical chemists have long been interested in analyzing gas density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at equations of state for the ideal gas and the van der Waals gas.  As we saw in class, there is another particularly powerful equation of state for a real gas, called the virial equation of state,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pV_m=RTZ\\qquad(1)$$ \t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $V_m=\\frac{V}{n}$ . In Eq. (1), Z is a unitless quantity called the compression factor.  Z is equal to 1 for an ideal gas, but for a real gas, Z may be greater than or less than 1, and its value depends on $p$, $T$, and $V_m$.  You can manipulate Eq. (1) to get the definition of Z:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z\\equiv\\frac{pV_m}{RT}\\qquad(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The neat idea of the virial equation is that we write Z as an infinite series in the number density, $\\rho_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z=1 + B\\rho_n + C\\rho_n^2 + D\\rho_n ^3 + ...\\qquad(3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where B, C, etc, are constants that depend on the temperature. This power series is very flexible because you can approximate any function with it if you include enough terms.  This means that the virial equation of state can be “molded” to describe any real gas if the correct coefficients B, C, etc are chosen.  \n",
