    "A probability density function describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable having a given value.  For example, gas molecules move over a continuous range of velocities and we can use the Boltzmann density function, $f_B$, to describe the x, y, or z-component of the velocity ($v_x$, $v_y$, or $v_z$).  In addition to a velocity component, this function also depends on the temperature (*T*) and the molar mass of the molecule (*M*); we say it is <em>parameterized</em> by these quantitites.  Similarly, the Maxwell density function, $f_M$, is a function of the speed (*v*), and is also parameterized by *T* and *M*.  Analytically, we write the Boltzmann density function as\n",
