    "Below, we reproduce the five equations of motion of Cambio1.0. Note that these equations are missing some feedback terms: there's no sigmoid term in Eq. 2 (we'll get to that in Cambio4.0) and there's no Henry's term in Eq. 3 (we'll get to that in Cambio2.0).\n",

    "There is, however, a very important feedback built into Eq. 2: as long as $k_{al1}$ is a positive number (which it is), Eq. 2 says that as humans put more carbon in the atmosphere (bigger $C_{atm}$), there will be an offsetting effect of greater flux from the atmosphere to the land (bigger $F_{atm->land}$). How does that happen physically? Experiments have shown that if you pump $CO_2$ into a greenhouse, plants in the greenhouse photosynthesize faster. \n",
