    "# Simple Radiative Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Absorbed Solar Radiation\n",
    "The energy responsible for keeping Earth warm comes almost entirely from the Sun. This energy is all \"light\", but humans can see only part of it; of the rest, some comes in the form of ultraviolet light (which we can detect because it burns our skin) and near-infrared light (which is what you are feeling when you hold your hands out in front of a fire). All three forms of light (uv, visible, and near-IR) are collectively called *shortwave radiation*. \n",
    "\n",
    "How intense is shortwave radiation from the sun? To answer that, we need to talk about an instrument for measuring shortwave flux, called a *shortwave radiometer*. Shortwave radiometers measure the amount of shortwave energy (remember, that's uv, visible, and near-IR) passing through a 1 meter x 1 meter hoop. Real shortwave radiometers aren't actually that big, but they still tell you that key number: the energy intensity of sunlight on a per-meter-squared basis.) \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now imagine you were are floating in space, just outside Earth's atmosphere, armed with your shortwave radiometer. It should read a number around $1367 \\ W m^{-2}$. Is that a lot? Well, $1367 \\ W m^{-2}$ is almost fourteen 100-Watt light bulbs, for every 1x1 square meter! This number is called the *solar constant*, and symbolized by $S_0$, so we say $S_0=1367 \\ W m^{-2}$. $S_0$ varies a little over the course of a year (and of course is smaller for planets farther from the sun, bigger for planets that are closer), but $1367$ is a good average for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, however, that $1367 \\ W m^{-2}$ doesn't actually make it down to every square meter of Earth's surface below you. There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sun shines only on one side of the planet at a time, and it usually hits Earth's surface at an oblique angle. Turns out, this reduces the average energy potentially received by earth by a factor of 4, i.e., we're talking $S_0/4=342 \\ Wm^{-2}$.\n",
    "2. Clouds, snowpacks, desert sand, even forests, tend to reflect the shortwave light away, back out to space. The overall fraction reflected is called Earth's *albedo*, and it's about 30%. The albedo is typically given the symbol $\\alpha$, and it's given as a fraction rather than a percent. So the statement \"Earth's albedo is 30%\" is written mathematically as $\\alpha=0.3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we put this all together, we can write down something called the *Absorbed Shortwave Radiation*, which we'll symbolize here as $ASR$. It can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ASR = \\dfrac{S_0}{4}(1-\\alpha) \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like $S_0$, the units of $ASR$ are $W m^{-2}$. If you plug in the above numbers for $S_0$ and $\\alpha$, you get $ASR=239 \\ W m^{-2}$. That's still a lot if you think about it in terms of light bulbs: it's like there are over two 100-W lightbulbs of sunlight being absorbed by Earth's surface, day and night, over every square meter of the planet's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outgoing Longwave Radiation\n",
    "Imagine now that you are standing at the earth's surface, armed with a *longwave radiometer*. That's an instrument that measures the longwave radiant energy passing through a 1 meter x 1 meter hoop. To a good approximation, we'd expect that number to be given by the expression $\\sigma T^4$, where $T$ is the temperature of the ground you're standing on. $\\sigma$ is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $5.67 \\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2}K^{-4}$. That's just physics, it doesn't depend on climate. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of radiative balance calculations, however, we need to re-position ourselves back to where we were at the beginning of this story: hovering in space just above Earth's atmosphere. Looking down at the earth's surface, the quantity our longwave radiometer measures now is called the Outgoing Longwave Radiation, or OLR. It will be, it turns out, not quite equal to the $\\sigma T^4$ coming off Earth's surface. Why? Well first, something like 85% of the longwave radiation emitted by Earth's surface gets captured by water vapor, $CO_2$ and $CH_4$ in the atmosphere (they're all *greenhouse gases*). So we'd expect OLR to be reduced to something like 15% of $\\sigma T^4$, right? However, it turns out that *the atmosphere itself emits longwave radiation*. Combining these influences, we can write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "OLR = \\kappa \\sigma T^4 \\ \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where (as it turns out) $\\kappa=0.614$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Here's a more technical version of what we just said: Atmospheric greenhouse gases absorb 85% of the longwave photons that originate from Earth's surface, but those same gases emit their own longwave photons. Those longwave photons that are emitted by the atmosphere back down toward the earth's surface are responsible for greenhouse warming. Those longwave photons that are emitted by the atmosphere out to space combine with the 15% of Earth's surface photons that manage to get through the atmosphere unscathed, adding up to 64% of the orignal Stefan-Boltzmann ($\\sigma T^4$) energy intensity coming off the earth's surface. That leads to the expression for the Outgoing Longwave Radiation in Eq. (2), with $\\kappa=0.614$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Radiative Balance\n",
    "All this leads to an algorithm for modeling climate, based on radiative balance. It goes like this: suppose the earth were initially really cold. Then $T$ in Eq. (2) would be small, and that would mean the outgoing longwave radiation, $OLR$, would also be small -- smaller than our ASR of $239 \\ W m^{-2}$ coming in. That means the earth's surface would be experiencing a *positive flux imbalance* -- more energy coming in than going out. What will the earth do then? Well, heat up of course! \n",
    "\n",
    "Things don't heat up instantly, however. If you're familiar with trying to boil water on a stovetop, you know that the more water in your pot, the longer it takes to heat up. We say that two gallons of water have twice the *heat capacity* as one gallon. The relevance of heat capacity to our climate model is, even when there's a positive flux imbalance, it would still take time to heat up. We can even write an equation for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta T = \\dfrac{ASR-OLR}{C_p}\\times \\Delta t \\ \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the earth's surface in the time $\\Delta t$, and $C_P$ is our symbol for the heat capacity -- in our model, the heat capacity of a square meter of the average Earth's surface. It turns out that this second number is known: $C_P\\approx 2.2\\times 10^8 \\ J \\ m^{-2}K^{-1}$. And notice that it's in the denominator -- which means larger heat capacity means smaller change in temperature. Another term in this equation worth noticing is $ASR-OLR$. $ASR-OLR$ is likely to be positive when the earth is cold (because Eq. (2) says $OLR$ will be small), which means there would be a positive flux difference, which would mean $\\Delta T>0$ (i.e. the temperature of the earth will *rise*). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine the opposite process when Earth's temperature is initially very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't mentioned the factor $\\Delta t$ yet. The lower case means we're talking about time, not temperature. And hopefully its appearance in Eq. (3) is fairly intuitive: the longer you heat something (bigger $\\Delta t$), the more it will heat up (bigger $\\Delta T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (3) is the key equation in our model. It allows us to start with a given temperature, $T$, then march through time, at each time step either raising the temperature or lowering it, according to whether $ASR-OLR$ is positive or negative. In \"pseudo-code\", we could say we have a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (Delta_T is big):\n",
    "        calculate OLR from the current temperature using Eq. (2)\n",
    "        calculate Delta_T from Eq. (3)\n",
    "        update temperature using T(new) = T(old) + Delta_T\n",
    "\n",
    "where Delta_T is what we've written here, mathematically, as $\\Delta T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the condition that we keep going as long as Delta_T is big? Well, there's no point in continuing on if there's no change in temperature, right? In fact, what you'll see is that the temperature calculated in this way evolves toward a *steady-state* value. If Earth is initially too cold, it gets warmer; if it's too hot, it cools down. That means it's not just any old steady state, it's a *stable* steady state. This is also called *homeostasis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Climate sensitivity to changes in albedo\n",
    "It turns out that in modeling the climate, a key thing one looks for is what's called the *climate sensitivity*. For example, we could say\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\dfrac {\\Delta T_{SS}}{\\Delta \\alpha} \\ \\ \\ \\ (4)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the sensitivity of Earth's temperature to its albedo ($\\alpha$). To find this number from our model, we'd need to run the model once with a \"reference\" value of the albedo, and then again with a new value of the albedo. We'll call the difference in these two albedos $\\Delta \\alpha$, and the difference in the resulting steady-state temperatures  $\\Delta T_{SS}$. From that, we can use Eq. (4) to calculate the climate sensitivity, $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, you'll do this, and then use the resulting value of $S$ to predict the impact some new albiedo might have on the temperature of the planet -- details to be given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "The model described here ignores a key feature of climate called *feedbacks*. For example, if lots of snow melts because of higher temperatures (which it will do), Earth's albedo will go down, which will cause Earth's temperature to rise, which will cause more snow to melt: a positive feedback. But that's a challenge for another day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "1. I'm conversant with fundamental quantities associated with radiative balance, like $\\alpha$, $S_o$, $ASR$, $OLR$, $\\kappa$, and $\\sigma$, and I can supply typical values, with units.\n",
    "1. I can explain the sense in which the termination of \"while\" loop in the model is consistent with a stable steady-state temperature (or *homeostasis*).\n",
    "1. I can explain how to calculate a *climate sensitivity (to albedo)*, and how to use that value as a predictive tool."
