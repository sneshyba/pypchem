    "## Introduction\n",
    "Because thermodynamic surfaces generally vary across state space, it follows that the *difference* between two such surfaces will also vary across state space. In this CGI, we'll be examining the enthalpy changes associated with phase changes in a $T,P$ state space, so that you can develop some familiarity with the quantitative application of these ideas. A key additional take-home message is that this kind of analysis applies broadly to other thermodynamic surfaces in other state spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The reference state\n",
    "We start with the assumption that we know the difference between two thermodynamic surfaces at some reference point in state space -- say $T_o$ and $P_o$. In the case of enthalpy in a temperature/pressure state space, for example, we'd symbolize this difference as something like $\\Delta H_{rxn}^o$, which is shorthand for the more careful designation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating $\\Delta(\\Delta H_{rxn})$ depends on where in state space we're interested in going, of course. In a temperature/pressure state space, that means isobaric changes in temperature, or isothermal changes in pressure. We'll tackle those next. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Isobaric changes in temperature\n",
    "For isobaric changes in temperature, we could say \n",
    "\n",

    "\\Delta(\\Delta H_{rxn}) = \\int_{T^o}^{T'} \\Delta C_P dT \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta C_P$ is the difference in heat capacities of the two states we're considering. To carry out this integration, we'd need to know how $\\Delta C_P$ depends on temperature. Under some circumstances, however, we might be able to get away with pretending the heat capacities are constant, in which case we'd make the approximation\n",
