    "where the notation $\\Delta G^o_{rxn}(T_2)$ means the (unmixed) Gibbs energy of reaction at temperature $T_2$, etc. This formula is of great practical value for predicting the Gibbs energy of a reaction at temperatures other than the reference temperature ($298 K$), because the only assumption built into it is that $\\Delta H^o_{rxn}$ doesn't change much with temperature, which is often a pretty reasonable assumption. \n",

You'll have to do a little work before you start, namely, to balance the equation, and then from a table (like https://engineering.wayne.edu/mechanical/pdfs/thermodynamic-_tables-updated.pdf) find $\\Delta G^o_{rxn}$ and $\\Delta H^o_{rxn}$. Don't forget that water in the products is in liquid form. You'll also want to solve Eq. 1 for $\\Delta G^o_{rxn}(T_2)$.\n",

    "## Historical note\n",
    "Wikipedia gives a derivation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, and some interesting historical background, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs-Helmholtz_equation. Here's part of their description:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was originally presented in an 1882 paper entitled \"Die Thermodynamik chemischer Vorgänge\" by Hermann von Helmholtz. It describes how the Gibbs free energy, which was presented originally by Josiah Willard Gibbs, varies with temperature. It was derived by Helmholtz first, and Gibbs derived it only 6 years later. The attribution to Gibbs goes back to Wilhelm Ostwald, who first translated Gibbs' monograph into German and promoted it in Europe.\"\n",

    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "I can use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to make quantitative predictions about the temperature dependence of $\\Delta G^o_{rxn}$."
