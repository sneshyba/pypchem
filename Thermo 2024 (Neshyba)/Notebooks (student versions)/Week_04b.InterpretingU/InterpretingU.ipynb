    "\n",
    "As this figure demonstrates, vibrations provide two different ways for a molecule to store energy. One is as *kinetic* energy -- since vibrations involve atoms moving. Another way is as *potential* energy. A good way to think about the latter is that molecules, like springs, can be coiled up or stretched out; either way, there's potential energy. Because of this, we say that each vibrational degree of freedom stores not just ${1 \\over 2} RT$ of energy, but twice that amount: a full $RT$! \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more complication. Whereas diatomic molecules can only vibrate by stretching, molecules with three or more atoms possess multiple ways (called *vibrational modes*). In the water molecule shown above, for example, we see that there are three vibrational modes: a symmetric stretch, an asymmetric stretch, and a bend. Each one can soak up a full $RT$ of energy! \n",

    "\n",
    "### In the sub-classical regime (i.e., low temperatures)\n",
    "What's going on at low temperatures? As it turns out, low temperatures reveal a quantum mechanical effect that's not evident at high temperature. Here's how the story goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "At low enough temperature, quantum mechanics allows (actually, forces) all molecules to vibrate a tiny amount, with an energy called the *ground-state* vibrational energy, but that's *all* the vibrational motion they get or can have. That, in turn, means that when you add heat to a gas sample at very low temperature, *vibrations can't soak up any of that heat*. This is equivalent to saying\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_{vib} \\approx 0$ for any molecule in the low-temperature limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, we'd say that the vibrational contribution to $C_V$ is zero at low temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitioning from sub-classical to classical regimes\n",
    "The reason for the above restriction is that molecules require a certain *minimum* amount of energy -- called a *quantum* of energy -- in order to vibrate with any energy in excess of the ground-state energy just mentioned. Typically, that quantum of energy is on the order of a dozens of $kJ \\over mol$. As we've seen, the energy available from collisions with other molecules is given by ${3 \\over 2} RT$, so at really low temperatures ($T$ close to $0 K$), there's not enough collisional energy to excite vibrations. Even at room temperature, when ${3 \\over 2} RT \\approx 4 {kJ/mol}$, the collisional energy is too small to excite the vibrational motion of more than a tiny fraction of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the temperature goes up, molecules are moving faster, and ${3 \\over 2} RT$ gets closer to that minimum quantum of energy required to make molecules vibrate. Some molecules begin vibrating. As temperature continues to increase, eventually all the molecules in a sample will have access to those higher vibrational states. That's the high-temperature, classical limit!\n",
    "\n",
    "On the way (from low temperature to high), there's a characteristic *thermal activation threshold*, which we'll call $T^*$. Crossing that threshold is called *thermal activation*, or more precisely *vibrational thermal activation*. Each molecule has a characteristic thermal activation temperature: for $F_2$, $T^* \\approx 400 K$, while for $HCl$, $T^* \\approx 1300 K$. Polyatomic molecules would, in principle, exhibit multiple activation temperatures (one for each vibrational mode), although these tend to blend together. In fact, what often sees is that $U(T)$ is increasing nonlinearly with temperature (or, equivalently, that the slope, $C_V$, is not constant). An example is shown in Fig. 2. \n",

    "To summarize, if you're tasked with determining whether a gas is monatomic or polyatomic, and all you have is a thermodynamic surface of $U$ to look at, just look to see whether $U$ increases linearly or nonlinearly with increasing temperature. If linear, you have a monatomic gas, if nonlinear, it's polyatomic!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Volume dependence of the internal energy\n",
    "You may have noticed there isn’t any volume dependence in the equations we've presented so far. There is a physical meaning behind this: since the ideal gas law neglects molecular size and intermolecular attractions, we say that the atoms or molecules in an ideal gas don’t know about one another. So you can think of the formulas for $U$ presented so far as being the energy of $n$ moles of isolated, non-interacting gas molecules.\n",

    "- When two gas molecules are very far from each other (i.e., at the far right of the graph), their intermolecular potential tends to zero -- that means, no interactions between them. \n",
    "- As our two molecules get closer to one another, they usually experience a mutual *attraction*. This attraction is signaled by a *lowering* of potential energy as the molecules get closer. (It's sometimes helpful to think of this in the reverse way: we know molecules are attracted to one another if it costs energy to pull them apart.) \n",
    "- When two molecules get *very* close, they push apart -- an intermolecular *repulsion*. This behavior can be seen in Fig. 3 by an *increase* in potential energy at close intermolecular distances (i.e., at the far left of the graph).\n",

    "The foregoing leads us to the following modification of Eq. (5):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_{real}(T,V) = [\\dfrac{3}{2} RT + f_{rot}(T) + f_{vib}(T)+ f_{intermol}(T,V)] \\times n \\ \\ \\ \\ (6)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{intermol}$ represents the sum of all the intermolecular interactions at any given instant in time. Notice that we're writing this as $f_{intermol}(T,V)$ to reflect the fact that volume makes a difference. We've also introduced a subscript, \"real\", to this formula. Why? If a gas behaves as ideal, its $U$ *can't have any volume dependence.* That means all the equations for $U$ we've presented so far, Eqs. 3-5, could describe an ideal gas, but Eq. 6 can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's a question: will $U_{real}$ be bigger or smaller than $U_{ideal}$, all else equal? That depends on the sign of $f_{intermol}$, which in turn depends on how close the molecules are to each other (as Fig. 3 shows): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For large volumes, molecules will usually be very far apart (extreme right in Fig. 3), so we can expect $f_{intermol} \\approx 0$. Since the only difference between $U_{real}$ and $U_{ideal}$ is $f_{intermol}$, we can predict that $U_{real} \\approx U_{ideal}$, i.e., real gases will tend to behave as ideal gases at large volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For intermediate volumes, molecules will be at an intermediate distance from one another (the middle region in Fig. 3), so we can expect $f_{intermol}<0$. Equation (3) says we can therefore predict that $U_{real} < U_{ideal}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For very small volumes, there will be a lot of molecules close to one another (the region at the extreme left in Fig. 3), so we can expect $f_{intermol} > 0$. That means we can predict that $U_{real}>U_{ideal}$ (but see the caveat below).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, if you're tasked with determining whether a gas is ideal or real, and all you have is a thermodynamic surface of $U$, just look to see whether there's any volume dependence. If there is, you are probably looking at a representation of a real gas. If not, it's probably ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A python note\n",
    "In this exercise, it will be useful to pull out isotherms and isochores from a given thermodynamic surfaces. You already know how to do this for the first and last slice -- but what if you want a slice somewhere in the middle? And what if you want a *particular* isotherm or isochore? This exercise shows you how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveat\n",
    "If you compress a gas to very small volumes, it tends to condense to form a liquid. We won't be getting to such small volumes in this exercise, so don't expect to see $U_{real}>U_{ideal}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About units\n",
    "The data stored in the files that you'll be picking up in this exercise are *almost* all SI, with the exception of the energy values stored in Ugrid1.txt, etc. We're going to make this an all-SI CGI, so we'll be converting the energies to Joules \"on the fly\", i.e., as we load that data into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "1. Given a thermodynamic surface $U(T,V)$, I can tell whether a gas is ideal vs real, and whether it is monatomic or polyatomic.\n",
    "1. Given a thermodynamic surface  $U(T,V)$, I can slice out isotherms (or isochores) that are as close as possible to a particular temperature (or volume).\n",
