    "## Introduction\n",
    "The phenomenon of freezing point depression appears in lots of places: it's why sea ice freezes at $-2 ^oC$, and it's why roads are often salted in wintertime. Our task here is to see if we can predict the magnitude of that depression from basic thermodynamic principles. On the way, we'll see the connection between two fundamental \"Laws\" of solution chemistry, attributed to Raoult and Blagden.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raoult and the case of the shifting triple point\n",
    "We'll begin with the liquid-vapor boundary line in a conventional phase diagram, given by the Clausius-Clapeyron Equation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P^* = P_3 \\times exp \\big (  -{\\Delta H_{vap} \\over nR} \\times ({1 \\over T} - {1 \\over T_3}) \\big ) \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we've introduced a \"$*$\" on the left hand to indicate that this expression works for pure solvents. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that when a solute is dissolved in a solvent, this pressure is reduced. You can see the effect in Fig. 1, in which a new solution-vapor boundary (shown in purple) lies below that of the original (teal-colored) liquid solvent boundary. Where the purple curve intersects the solid-liquid curve defines a new triple point, and therefore a new freezing temperature. \n",
    "\n",

    "<strong>Figure 1</strong>. Freezing point depression in a phase diagram.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perhaps obvious to you that this shift will be greater when there's more solute dissolved in the solvent. The connection is given by *Raoult's Law*,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{H_2O}=\\chi_{H_2O} \\times P_{H_2O}^* \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\chi_{H_2O}$ is the mole fraction of the *solvent* (here, water) when something is dissolved in it. We can relate that value to the *solute's* concentration according to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\chi_{H_2O} = \\frac 1 {1+M_{H_2O} b_B} \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we've added subscripts to remind ourselves that ${H_2O}$ is the solvent and B is a solute. The quantity $b_B$ in this equation is what's called the *molality* of the solute, defined as the moles of solute (say, aqueous B) divided by kg of solvent (e.g., water). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from Eqs. 2 and 3 that the purple curve (the solution-vapor phase boundary) *has* to lie below that of the teal curve (the pure solvent's vapor phase boundary) because $\\chi_{H_2O} < 1$, and therefore The amount by which the new triple point *has* to lie to the left (i.e., be colder) than the original. The shift to the left is called $\\Delta T_F$, or the \"freezing point depression\" of the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Blagden's Law\n",
    "It turns out that linearization of the governing equations (a phrase that buries a lot of theory!) leads to the approximation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta T_F = K_A \\times b_B \\ \\ \\ (4) \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $K_A$ is called the solvent's *cryoscopic constant*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea of this CGI\n",
    "The idea of this CGI is to use Raoult's Law to tabulate (in a spreadsheet) how the resulting freezing point depression, $\\Delta T_F$, depends on $b$. Once you have enough points, you'll be able to find the slope of $\\Delta T_F$ as a function of $b$, which is $K_A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "1. I can explain what molality is, and compute mole fractions from it.\n",
    "1. I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in combination with Raoult's law to predict the freezing temperature of an aqueous solution with a given concentration of solute.\n",
    "1. I can use Raoult's Law in combination with a spreadsheet to obtain a value of a solvent's cryoscopic constant. "
