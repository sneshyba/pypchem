    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The enthalpy of a gas can be approximated as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(T,P) = [{5 \\over 2}RT + f_{rot}(T) + f_{vib}(T) + f_{intermol}(T,P)] \\times n \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where, for a vdw gas, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{intermol}(T,P) \\approx P(b - {{2a}\\over{RT}}) \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes about this: \n",
    "- The term ${5 \\over 2}RT$ comes from the fact that there's ${3 \\over 2}RT$ in translational kinetic energy, plus $RT$ as an approximation to the $PV$ in $H=U+PV$. \n",
    "- The terms $f_{rot}(T)$ and $f_{vib}(T)$ are our old friends that appeared in $U(T,V)$.\n",
    "- The slope of $H(T,P)$ in the temperature direction, $\\bigl ( {\\partial H \\over \\partial T} \\bigr )_P$, is called the *constant-pressure heat capacity*, $C_P$.\n",
    "- The slope of $H(T,P)$ in the pressure direction, $\\bigl ( {\\partial H \\over \\partial P} \\bigr )_T$, is called the *isothermal Joule-Thomson coefficient*, $\\mu_T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The twist\n",
    "So much for the math ... what does $H(T,P)$ *look like*? That's what we'll be doing here: inspecting the enthalpy of a van der Waals gas as a thermodynamic surface, in a temperature/pressure state space. One thing you'll be able to see from this is that $H(T,P)$ has a kind of twist: at low temperatures, the slope in the pressure direction ($\\mu_T$) is negative, but at a high enough temperature, that slope becomes positive. The temperature at which this transition happens is called the *inversion temperature*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Isenthalps and the Joule-Thomson experiment\n",
    "We'll be introducing in this exercise a new way of looking at those surfaces: contour plots. What are contour plots? If you're familiar with hiking around in mountains, you might have used *elevation contour* maps. Lines on elevation contour maps tell you paths of constant altitude. Likewise, contour plots of $H(T,P)$ show paths for which the *enthalpy* remains constant. Such paths even have a special term in the lingo of Thermodynamics: they're called *isenthalps*. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that isenthalps are key to an experiment, called the *Joule-Thomson* experiment, in which a compressed gas (i.e., at high pressure) is allowed to escape through a throttle (see, e.g., https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/113330/pic1.png?revision=1). In doing so, it turns out that the enthalpy of the gas remains constant -- i.e., the gas follows those isenthalps as it escapes through the throttle. By inspecting contours of $H(T,P)$, we can see how much the temperature is expected to change. We can also use contours of $H(T,P)$ to identify a key switch-over point, namely, the temperature at which isenthalps change from curving toward lower temperatures, to curving toward higher temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## van der Waals prediction of the inversion temperature\n",
    "It turns out that in the case of a van der Waals gas, we can predict the inversion temperature by noting that, at the inversion temperature,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_T\\approx b - {{2a}\\over{RT}}=0 \\ \\ \\ (3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and solving for the temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "1. I can plot $H(T,P)$ for a given van der Waals gas, as a thermodynamic surface and as a contour map, and describe what an *isenthalp* is.\n",
    "1. I can identify the inversion temperature from such plots.\n",
    "1. I can use vdw theory to predict the inversion temperature of a gas."
