    "The entropy of a system is directly related to the number of  microstates in a system.  A microstate is  a way that energy can be stored in the system, or a way that the system can be arranged.  If a state has multiple ways to obtain a certain arrangement (more microstates at a given energy level level) then it will be more probable that a system can end up in that state. \n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we discussed a 'game' in which we have a protein that has multiple 'states' (conformations, or 3D shapes of the protein).  The folded 'F' state is lower in energy becuase of attractions between the atoms in the protein in the folded state.  The unfolded 'U' state is higher in energy because the protein is more spread out so the attractions are weaker.  However, the 'U' state is \"floppy\" and there are multiple different 'U' states (numbered 'U1', 'U2', ...) that have the same energy, corresponding to different unfolded conformations of the protein.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At low temperature, there is less kinetic energy, so when a protein enters the low energy 'F' state it is hard for it to break the attractions between the atoms in the protein.  This means  that there is a low (but not zero) probability of leaving the F state once you are in it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At high temperature, there is more kinetic energy, so when a protein enters the low energy 'F' state it is easier for the protein to break its intermolecular interactions and unfold into one of the 'U' states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We then discussed a 'game' in which we imagine the protein starting in one of the states.  At each step of the game, we do the following:\n",
    "1. Note which state the molecule is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   b. If the new state the protein is moving to is *the same* energy (a move from F to F, or from U to U), the protein makes the move, and the game starts over at (1)   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   c. If the new state we are moving to is *higher in energy* then the protein has a *chance* of making the move.  The liklihood of making the move depends on the temperature.  Continue to step 4.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. To check whether the protein moves to a higher energy state, roll the blue die.  At low temperature, the chance of moving to a higher energy state is low, so the protein makes the move only if the blue die roll is a '6'.  If the blue die is not a '6', then the protein stays in its current state.\n",
    "\n",
    " At high temperature, the probability of moving to the high energy state is higher, so the  protein makes the move if the blue die comes up 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n",
